# ROUGE
#### Rouge is my latest e-commerce site built with React and Ruby on Rails.
#### I have a strong interest in e-commerce websites and I wanted to utilize my newest skill-set in using Ruby on Rails for the back-end functionality.

#### Built with React and Ruby on Rails
#### It contains login/register authentication and a built-out wishlist with full CRUD functionality.

### Installation
#### npm install

### How To Use Functionality
#### Start off at the home page where you are able to see product displayed via a carousel. Head to the 'Shop' page where the user can add products from the inventory and add it to their wishlist.
